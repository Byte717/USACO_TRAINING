1.Concept
- Know your Topic


2.Framework
- Ask questions on what might be able to solve this problem
- Try different things and don't get stuck on one idea

3.Form
-After you identify the topic, each topic can be broken into solving a couple different types of problems
- Find those "Forms" decide which one to use


4. Tactic
- Important ideas you need to know to solve a problem with a certain form and framework
- Important optimizations with implementation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WITH EVERY PROBLEM,ONE NEW THING SHOULD BE ADDED TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE AS ONE OF THE MENTIONED BEFORE.


What I learned? Vampiric Powers 
- boolean arrays can be used to speed up the solution (tactic)
- Concept: Xor ranges
    - Intersections of ranges cancel out
