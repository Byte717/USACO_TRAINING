1.Concept
- Know your Topic


2.Framework
- Ask questions on what might be able to solve this problem
- Try different things and don't get stuck on one idea

3.Form
-After you identify the topic, each topic can be broken into solving a couple different types of problems
- Find those "Forms" decide which one to use


4. Tactic
- Important ideas you need to know to solve a problem with a certain form and framework
- Important optimizations with implementation


-go back to past problems, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WITH EVERY PROBLEM,ONE NEW THING SHOULD BE ADDED TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE AS ONE OF THE MENTIONED BEFORE.


What I learned? Vampiric Powers 
- boolean arrays can be used to speed up the solution (tactic)
- Concept: Xor ranges
    - Intersections of ranges cancel out


What I learned: TenzingBalls
- instead of dp[i][j], you can break it into 2 separate arrays to speed up the time
- you can use inverse counting, dont count the answer, count n-ans

What I learned charBlock: 
-string hashing
-Queues can be used for queries that last for a time


WHat I Learned Flipper:
- Put bigger values first to maximize lexographical order

What I learned Contrast Value:
-For minimizing, considering greedily what can be removed
-Use a condition, like in dp

What i learned Array Painting:
- when counting a solution, think of how you can earn just 1 of something
- like in this problem, how can you use 1 coin to maximize numbers painted
- Segment the input into different pieces

What I learned Bracket Coloring:
- Greedy involves grouping your input

WHat I learned Freedom:
    - For divisibility problems, check the divisors of the number

What I learned Drawing Trees:
- find how to optimize problems with using base cases for what is visited
- like id represents 0 if the node was not added


WHat I learned Fibonacharsis:
- Try looking at solving brute force in reverse for a faster solution\

WHat I learned Phase Shift:
    - Lexographic implies greedy to take the smallest or largest character possible.
    
what I learned White Black Subtrees:
    - tree dp can be used to count solutions for subtrees.

WHat I learned Selfie:
- Binary search can be used to find values for queries.
- Difference EQUATION can be used to find if 2 equations intersect.

WHat I learned Interview:
    - Binary search can be used to search an interval

    
What I learned living sequence:
    - When dealing with number theory, break it into digits and look at them individually
    - base conversion is basically modding the number and dividing repeatedly.

What I learned Pull Luck:
    - the sum of numbers from 1 to 2*n is divisible by n; after that, the remainders repeat.
    - so check divisibility from 1 to 2*n

What I learned Redistributing gifts:
- kosaraju's algorithm
- SCCs can be used to solve graph problems.

what I learned Cow at large:
    - you can start bfs from multiple places

what I learned Fenced in Gold:(revisit)
    - try to make grid problems into graph problems
    
what I learned Berry Picking:
    - Think of setting upper bounds to minimize values in greedy

What I learned: 
    - in Greedy, think of approaches and take the best one!

What I learned QuizMaster:
    - in 2 pointer approach, keep moving the second pointer forward while you still can greedily
    - in number theory, store ther factors.

What I learned Lucky Sum:
    - in number theory, thoink of how you can store and construct the numbers with limitations
    - whenever something repeats, think of what interval it repeats on
    - use lower bound to speed up queries.

What I learned T-primes:
    - use the Sieve to find prime numbers for number theory

WHat I learned Xenia Divisors:
    - when constructing a solution, keep a track of what you have in a frequency array.

WHat I learned Chosing teams: 
    - just keep a count of what works individually and calculate from there in greedy
    - like the answer would be individual/3
    
What I learned Road Construction:
    - Star graphs, graphs that have a center
