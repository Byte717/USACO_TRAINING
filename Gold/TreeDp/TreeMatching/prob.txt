You are given a tree consisting of n
 nodes.

A matching is a set of edges where each node is an endpoint of at most one edge. What is the maximum number of edges in a matching?

Input

The first input line contains an integer n
: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,…,n
.

Then there are n−1
 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a
 and b
: there is an edge between nodes a
 and b
.

Output

Print one integer: the maximum number of pairs.

Constraints
1≤n≤2⋅105

1≤a,b≤n

Example

Input:
5
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
2

Explanation: One possible matching is (1,2)
 and (3,4)
.
